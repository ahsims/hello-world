The Applied Bioinformatics of Cancer (ABC) group aims to bridge the gap between basic and clinical research using high-throughput genomic approaches. These techniques generate large volumes of data that allow us to test and generate hypotheses to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular changes responsible for cancer development and progression, along with the implications for improving treatment and prevention.
